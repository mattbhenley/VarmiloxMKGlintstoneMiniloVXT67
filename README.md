this lovely keyboard came with no instructions so I am collecting info here for future buyers

This gives some basic info but what about the light settings? How can I turn them off? Can I change the color? 

So here goes what I found  nd: 

Fn + X = turn lights on and off 
Fn + [] = change light effects 
Fn + up and down arrows = change brightness of rgb
Fn + left and right = change light speed (if applicable) 
Fn + Alt + Page Up or Page Down = change color 
Fn + D + Enter = Reset to default settings
